    "'''Q1.what is an exception? write the difference between exception and syntax error.\n",
    "\n",
    "An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. \n",
    "It typically arises from conditions that are unexpected or erroneous for a given context. In many programming languages, \n",
    "exceptions are often handled using a specialized construct, such as a \"try-except\" block, which allows a program to handle\n",
    "or recover from exceptional situations gracefully instead of crashing or terminating unexpectedly.\n",
    "For example, in Python, if you try to divide by zero, you'll get a ZeroDivisionError, which is a type of exception. \n",
    "\n",
    "A syntax error, on the other hand, occurs when a program has incorrect syntax, or structure, \n",
    "that the language's parser cannot understand. These errors are detected before a program is executed.\n",
    "It's akin to grammatical errors in natural language.\n",
